# ProjectVictor
Yet another C++ 128-bit unsigned int library.

### TODO:
 - [ ] Test modulus
 - [x] Possibly optimize with SSE instructions [see](https://github.com/TheAbyssBr0/ProjectVictor/wiki/Why-I-won't-be-using-SSE-instructions.)
 - [x] Benchmark

All the library functions are documented in the [header](https://github.com/TheAbyssBr0/ProjectVictor/blob/main/include/u_very_long.hpp) file
